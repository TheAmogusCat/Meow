# insultfilter
Filter out the insults, not the expressions of emotion

This neural network is designed to filter out insults in Russian and not only (e.g. faggot, but not fuck).

# Dataset example
```json
{
    "dataset": [
        {"text": "you faggot", "state": 1},
        {"text": "you good", "state": 0},
        ...
    ]
}
```
